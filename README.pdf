Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study. The goal is to analyze
Cyclisticâ€™s historical bike-share trip data to identify differences between casual riders and annual
members, and provide recommendations to increase memberships.
n Project Overview
- Business Task: Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently,
and suggest strategies to convert casual riders into members.
- Data: Publicly available Cyclistic trip data (12 months of .csv files).
- Tools Used: R (tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2), GitHub for version control.
n Key Findings
- Casual riders prefer longer rides, especially on weekends and with electric bikes.
- Members ride more often during weekdays and commuting hours.
- Members have shorter, consistent ride lengths.
n Key Visualizations
1. Rides per Month (Members vs Casuals)
2. Average Ride Length by Day of Week
3. Bike Type Usage
n Recommendations
1. Launch targeted weekend/electric bike membership offers.
2. Highlight cost savings of membership compared to casual rides.
3. Run location-based campaigns at top casual stations
